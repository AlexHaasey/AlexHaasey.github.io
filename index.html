        <h1>Alex Haas Travels</h1>

        <p>Ever since I was a child, my family's love for travel has taken me all over the world, from exotic jungles to barren deserts and everything in between. These travels have defined much of who I am and awakened a curious side of me that yearns for exploration. Being fully entrenched in different cultures is so exciting and has given me so much perspective on how to live my life.</p>

        <p>5 summers ago, I went on a service trip to Thailand for a month. While I spent a lot of that time in big cities like Bangkok and Changmai, I spent 2 weeks of that time living with a hill tribe up in Northern Thailand. From farming in the rice fields, to tutoring Thai kids in English, to helping build a new elementary school, those two weeks spent fully emersed in another culture were the most gratifying weeks of my life.</p>
